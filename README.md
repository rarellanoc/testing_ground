A silly oracle using wikiquote

This is an experiment to fool myself, seeking how far out minds go in generating random relations if a quote, or aphorism is generated randomly after you ask a question. 

There is no complex computational relation between question and answer, just like an oracle. 

This script gained relevance after a conversation, and hearing that AI chat systems were used as an oracle. I remembered this script, so now it's public. 

You need python3. 

Ideally install wikiquotes and wikiquote (the requirements) on virtualenv. 

The results are saved in a .txt. 


Enjoy
